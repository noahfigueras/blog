What should be a true decentralized Freelance Platform: 

1. Companies must post offer and pay for their completion.
2. Freelancers should be able to apply and work on the projects that companies 
need to be done.
3. Freelancers working on a same project must be able to collaborate together 
and have good communication. 
4. Payments should be paid in crypto. 
5. There should be intermediate people (working as freelancers as well) that 
do mediation between companies and freelancer to ensure a fair market and resolve
disputes. 
6. Money should be escrowed. 
7. Freelancers should earn a rank in their releated fields. You can hire the best
for a big price, but you can also hire very competent people that are starting for
lower amounts. 
8. No comissions should be implemented for freelancers or small projects. Maybe
companies can opt for a top-tier with more features to manage more freelancers. 
Also, donations should be accepted for the maintanance of the project. Freelancers 
can buy ads to promote their services as well as companies.
