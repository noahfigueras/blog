Companies must post offer and pay for their completion. Freelancers should be able to apply and work on the projects that companies need to be done.

There should be intermediate people (working as freelancers as well) that do mediation between companies and freelancer to ensure a fair market and resolve disputes. Money should be escrowed. Freelancers should earn a rank in their releated fields. You can hire the best for a big price, but you can also hire very competent people that are starting for lower amounts. No comissions should be implemented for freelancers or small projects. Maybe companies can opt for a top-tier with more features to manage more freelancers.
